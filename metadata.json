Remembering this will save you many a headache.\n\n## Overview\n=================\nThere are three core recipes to this cookbook:\n1) ipsec - core ipsec daemons (pluto for ikev1, charon for ikev2), configured according to the chosen scenario:\n  a) xauth-psk - XAUTH with a pre-shared key\n  b) xauth-id-psk-config - as above, and also able to allocate IP addresses (default)\n2) xl2tp - Level 2 tunneling (for Macintosh, etc. clients)\n3) routing - set up sysctl and iptables to allow ipsec to do NAT for internal VPN hosts\n  NOTE: this recipe does some unsafe manipulation of core config files; beware using it on a non-dedicated server\n\nxl2tp depends on ipsec; routing technically doesn't, but isn't likely to be functional without it.",
